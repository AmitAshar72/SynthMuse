# Synthmuse
SynthMuse tests how Virtual Reality interacting techniques enhance musical expression in audio synthesis for games
The files in this repository are Unity project file 
User must have Oculus rift VR with controller for optimal experience

# Critical analysis 
It was noted that testers with musical background managed to work around the interfaces quicker than the testers with non-musical background. Graphical data suggested that the time it took for the users to match notes and sequence showed negative slopes when plotted against each other, which means that the time taken to match the notes and sequence decreased while moving forward with the experiment. The data sets, and questionnaire suggested potential beneficial outcomes with using virtual interfaces to enhance musical expression in audio synthesis but the data sets were not enough in number to provide a concrete result.
